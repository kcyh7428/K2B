description: Create or update notes in the K2B Obsidian vault with correct frontmatter, cross-links, and MOC integration. Use when creating any new note in the vault, or when updating an existing note after progress is made on a project, person, or decision. Also use when another skill (k2b-daily-capture, k2b-meeting-processor, k2b-tldr, k2b-insight-extractor) needs to create or update a linked note.

# K2B Vault Writer

Create notes in the K2B Obsidian vault at `~/Projects/K2B-Vault/` with correct structure, frontmatter, cross-links, and MOC integration.

## System Reference

Before writing any note, review the lifecycle rules in [[context_k2b-note-lifecycle]] (`Notes/Context/context_k2b-note-lifecycle.md`). That note is the single source of truth for origin tagging, review properties, promote destinations, and the content pipeline.

## Vault Query Tools

- **Dataview DQL** (structured frontmatter queries): `~/Projects/K2B/scripts/vault-query.sh dql '<TABLE query>'`
- **Full-text search**: `mcp__obsidian__search` MCP tool or `vault-query.sh search "<term>"`
- **Read file**: `mcp__obsidian__get_file_contents` or Read tool
- **List files**: `mcp__obsidian__list_files_in_dir`
- **Patch content**: `mcp__obsidian__patch_content` for surgical frontmatter or section updates

Use `mcp__obsidian__search` or `mcp__obsidian__list_files_in_dir` to verify wikilink targets exist. Use `mcp__obsidian__patch_content` for targeted frontmatter updates without rewriting entire files.

## Before Writing Any Note

1. **Read the appropriate template** from `Templates/` to get the base structure
2. **Check for duplicates** -- use `mcp__obsidian__search` or Glob to check if target note already exists
3. **Verify link targets** -- before writing `[[person_Firstname-Lastname]]`, use `mcp__obsidian__search` or Glob to confirm the file exists. If not, note it as a stub to create later.

## Updating Existing Notes

When progress is made on a project, person interaction occurs, or a decision evolves, update the existing note rather than creating a new one.

### When to Update
- After `/tldr` captures progress related to a project
- After `/meeting` processes a meeting tied to a project or person
- After `/daily` captures completed work items tied to a project
- Any time K2B works on implementation of a project and makes meaningful progress
- When new relationships or links are discovered between existing notes

### Update Workflow
1. **Glob** to find the target note (e.g., `wiki/projects/project_*.md`)
2. **Read** the current content
3. **Determine which sections need updates:**
   - `## Current Status` -- rewrite the blockquote to reflect current state
   - `## Key Milestones` -- check off completed items (`- [x]`), add new milestones if needed
   - `## Updates` -- append a new dated entry (`### YYYY-MM-DD`) with bullet points of what changed
   - `## Related Notes` -- add wikilinks to any new related notes (meetings, decisions, insights)
   - For person notes: append new interactions under `## Key Interactions`
4. **Use Edit tool** (not Write) to surgically update sections without touching unrelated content
5. **Verify** wikilinks in new content point to existing notes (glob first)

### Update Rules
- Never overwrite the entire file -- only edit changed sections
- Always append to `## Updates` -- never remove previous entries
- When checking off milestones, preserve the original text and just change `[ ]` to `[x]`
- Add the date to checked-off milestones: `- [x] KIRA AirTable migration (2026-03-23)`
- If a note doesn't have an `## Updates` section, add one at the bottom before the last section

## File Naming Conventions

| Note Type | Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Project | `project_lowercase-slug.md` | `project_signal-monitoring.md` |
| Person | `person_Firstname-Lastname.md` | `person_Gerard-Walker.md` |
| Insight | `insight_topic-slug.md` | `insight_two-stage-ai-prevents-hallucination.md` |
| Reference | `YYYY-MM-DD_source_topic-slug.md` | `2026-03-25_youtube_ai-writing-dan-koe.md` |
| Content Idea | `content_short-slug.md` | `content_corporate-ai-restrictions.md` |
| Meeting | `YYYY-MM-DD_Meeting-Topic.md` | `2026-03-22_Hiring-Sync.md` |
| MOC | `MOC_Topic-Name.md` | `MOC_SJM-Work.md` |
| Daily | `YYYY-MM-DD.md` | `2026-03-22.md` |
| Business | `entityname_overview.md` | `talentsignals_overview.md` |

| Work (SJM) | `work_lowercase-slug.md` | `work_the-eight-chef-search.md` |

## File Locations (Raw/Wiki Architecture)

K2B uses a 3-layer vault architecture (Karpathy model):
- **raw/** -- Immutable source captures. LLM reads only, never modifies after creation.
- **wiki/** -- LLM-compiled knowledge pages. K2B owns and maintains this layer.
- **review/** -- Items requiring Keith's judgment (content ideas, contradictions).

### Capture Skills -> raw/

| Capture Type | Raw Destination | Then |
|--------------|----------------|------|
| YouTube video | `raw/youtube/` | Trigger k2b-compile |
| Meeting transcript | `raw/meetings/` | Trigger k2b-compile |
| Research briefing | `raw/research/` | Trigger k2b-compile |
| TLDR | `raw/tldrs/` | Trigger k2b-compile |
| Daily extracts | `raw/daily/` | Trigger k2b-compile |

### Wiki Pages (compiled output)

| Note Type | Wiki Destination | Created By |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| Project | `wiki/projects/` | k2b-compile or direct |
| Person | `wiki/people/` | k2b-compile or direct |
| Concept | `wiki/concepts/` | k2b-compile |
| Insight | `wiki/insights/` | k2b-compile or /insight |
| Reference | `wiki/reference/` | k2b-compile |
| Work (SJM) | `wiki/work/` | k2b-compile or direct |
| Content idea (adopted) | `wiki/content-pipeline/` | /inbox promote |
| Context | `wiki/context/` | Direct write |

### Review Queue

| Type | Destination | Needs Keith's Review? |
|------|------------|----------------------|
| Content Idea (k2b-generate) | `review/` | **Yes** -- Keith decides |
| Compile conflicts | `review/` | **Yes** -- contradictions |
| Lint findings | `review/` | **Yes** -- semantic issues |

### Other Locations (unchanged)

| Note Type | Folder |
|-----------|--------|
| Daily note | `Daily/` |
| MOC | Vault root |
| Generated images | `Assets/images/` |
| Generated audio | `Assets/audio/` |
| Generated video | `Assets/video/` |
| Home | Vault root |

### TLDR Handling
TLDRs save to raw/tldrs/ as immutable captures. k2b-compile then digests them:
- Insights compiled into `wiki/insights/`
- Content seeds compiled into `wiki/content-pipeline/` or `review/` (if k2b-generate)
- Extract action items --> update relevant project/work notes
- Archive the TLDR shell --> `Archive/`

### What Goes to review/
ONLY items requiring Keith's judgment: `origin: k2b-generate` content suggestions, compile conflicts, lint contradictions. If review/ has anything else, something is misrouted.

## Frontmatter Conventions

### All notes get:
```yaml
---
tags: [type-tag, domain-tags...]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
type: project | work | person | insight | content-idea | moc | daily | reference | k2b-feature
origin: keith | k2b-extract | k2b-generate
up: "[[relevant MOC or Home]]"
---
```

### Origin field guide:
- `keith` -- Keith's direct input, words, ideas, decisions
- `k2b-extract` -- K2B extracted/summarized from Keith's input (meeting summaries, video takeaways from Keith's reactions)
- `k2b-generate` -- K2B generated independently (connections, patterns, suggestions, recommendations)
- When a note mixes both, use the primary origin and distinguish sections with callouts: `> [!quote] Keith's input` and `> [!robot] K2B analysis`

### Review properties
All notes saved to review/ must include these properties for Keith's Obsidian review:
- `review-action:` -- empty until Keith decides (promote, archive, delete, revise)
- `review-notes: ""` -- Keith's feedback/comments

### Content Pipeline
- `/content` suggestions land in `review/` with `origin: k2b-generate`
- Only when Keith says "promote this" does it move to `wiki/content-pipeline/` with `origin: keith`
- `wiki/content-pipeline/` is Keith's curated list of adopted content ideas

### Type-specific fields:

**Project** (things Keith builds/creates personally):
```yaml
status: on | ongoing | simmering | sleeping | parked
priority: high | medium | low
domain: talentsignals | agency-at-scale | signhub | personal | k2b
```

**Work** (SJM role responsibilities Keith drives/oversees):
```yaml
status: on | active | simmering
priority: high | medium | low
domain: sjm
```
Work notes use a simpler structure: Context, Current Status, Key Decisions, People, Open Questions, Updates. No milestones -- Keith drives these through his team, not as personal deliverables.

**Person:**
```yaml
organization: Company Name
role: Their Role
relationship: [colleague, stakeholder, report, external, partner, client]
```

**Content Idea:**
```yaml
platform: [linkedin, youtube]
status: idea | outline | draft | ready | published
source: "[[source note]]"
```

**Decision:**
```yaml
project: "[[project_name]]"
status: active | superseded | revisit
```

**Insight:**
```yaml
domain: sjm | talentsignals | agency-at-scale | technical | career
content-potential: true | false
```

## Cross-Linking Rules

1. **Always use wikilinks**: `[[filename_without_extension]]` for all internal links
2. **People links**: `[[person_Firstname-Lastname]]`
3. **Project links**: `[[project_slug]]`
4. **Decision links**: `[[YYYY-MM-DD_decision-topic]]`
5. **MOC uplinks**: Every note must have an `up` field in frontmatter pointing to its parent MOC
6. **Bidirectional**: When creating a note that references another note, add a backlink in the referenced note's Related Notes section if practical
7. **Stub creation**: If a link target doesn't exist, create a minimal stub note with just frontmatter and a `> Stub -- to be populated` callout

## MOC Integration

After creating any note, add its link to the relevant MOC under the appropriate section header. The five MOCs are:

- `[[MOC_SJM-Work]]` -- SJM team, searches, decisions, meetings
- `[[MOC_TalentSignals]]` -- Signal Monitoring, R2, Reverse Recruiter, RecruitClaw, clients
- `[[MOC_Agency-at-Scale]]` -- Business overview, historical client work
- `[[MOC_Content-Pipeline]]` -- Content ideas, insights with content potential
- `[[MOC_K2B-System]]` -- Vault conventions, migration, system notes

A note can appear in multiple MOCs (e.g., an insight about AI that also has content potential goes in both TalentSignals and Content Pipeline MOCs).

## Writing Style

- No em dashes. Use -- (double hyphen) if needed.
- No AI cliches or filler.
- Write in Keith's voice: direct, specific, no generic language.
- Section headers match the template structure.
- Populate sections with real data, not placeholder text. If data isn't available, use `> [!todo] To be populated` callout.
- Keep notes scannable. Bullet points over paragraphs where appropriate.

## Obsidian Syntax Reference

For Obsidian-specific syntax beyond standard markdown (callouts, embeds, math, mermaid diagrams, footnotes, block IDs, comments, highlights), read `references/obsidian-syntax.md` in this skill's directory.

## Template Reference

Templates are at `~/Projects/K2B-Vault/Templates/`:
- `daily-note.md`
- `project-note.md`
- `person-note.md`
- `meeting-note.md`
- `content-idea.md`
- `decision-log.md`

For MOCs, insights, and reference docs, no template exists. Use the frontmatter conventions above and a clean markdown structure.

## Asset Embedding

When notes reference generated media (from `/media` or MiniMax MCP tools), use Obsidian embed syntax:

- Images: `![[Assets/images/YYYY-MM-DD_image_slug.png]]`
- Audio: `![[Assets/audio/YYYY-MM-DD_speech_slug.mp3]]`
- Video: `![[Assets/video/YYYY-MM-DD_video_slug.mp4]]`

Asset naming: `YYYY-MM-DD_type_slug.ext` where type is `image`, `speech`, `music`, or `video`.

Content ideas with generated assets should have a `## Generated Assets` section containing embed links.

## Review Queue Write Contract

**review/ holds ONLY items requiring Keith's judgment.** Content ideas (k2b-generate), compile conflicts, lint contradictions.

Skills that write to review/: `k2b-insight-extractor` (content suggestions), `k2b-compile` (conflicts), `k2b-lint` (contradictions).

**Every note saved to `review/` MUST have these frontmatter fields:**

```yaml
review-action:       # empty string -- Keith fills this in Obsidian
review-notes: ""     # empty string -- Keith fills this in Obsidian
```

**Before writing any review note, verify:**
1. The item genuinely requires Keith's judgment (not auto-promotable)
2. `review-action:` is present in frontmatter (empty value is correct)
3. `review-notes: ""` is present in frontmatter
4. File path starts with `review/`

If you're updating an existing review note, preserve any `review-action` or `review-notes` values Keith has already set.

## Index Update Contract (MANDATORY)

**Every note created or updated must also update the relevant index.md.** No exceptions.

After writing or updating any vault note:
1. **Read** the folder's `index.md` (e.g., `wiki/projects/index.md` or `raw/youtube/index.md`)
2. **If new note**: Add a row to the index table with `[[filename]]`, one-line summary, and date
3. **If updated note**: Update the summary and date in the existing row if the summary changed
4. **If note moved/deleted**: Remove the old index entry, add to new location's index
5. **Update wiki/index.md** master catalog entry counts if wiki/ subfolder changed

Index format (one line per page, keep it short):
```markdown
| [[page-name]] | One-line summary | YYYY-MM-DD |
```

### Wiki indexes (primary):
- `wiki/index.md` (master catalog)
- `wiki/people/index.md`
- `wiki/projects/index.md`
- `wiki/work/index.md`
- `wiki/concepts/index.md`
- `wiki/insights/index.md`
- `wiki/reference/index.md`
- `wiki/content-pipeline/index.md`
- `wiki/context/index.md`

### Raw indexes:
- `raw/index.md` (master catalog)
- `raw/youtube/index.md`
- `raw/meetings/index.md`
- `raw/research/index.md`
- `raw/tldrs/index.md`
- `raw/daily/index.md`

### Legacy indexes (Notes/ -- kept as fallback):
- `Notes/People/index.md` through `Notes/Features/index.md`

## Post-Write Cross-Link Pass

After creating any note, run a cross-link pass to connect it to existing vault content:

1. **Scan the new note** for mentions of people, projects, work items, or concepts
2. **For each mentioned entity**:
   - Glob to check if a page exists (e.g., `wiki/people/person_*.md`)
   - If exists: add a wikilink in the new note AND add a dated backlink in the entity page's `## Updates` or `## Key Interactions` section
   - If not exists: create a stub from template in wiki/{subfolder}/, add to index
3. **Update `wiki/log.md`**: Append an entry recording what was created and cross-linked

Log entry format:
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] <skill> | <note title>
- Created: <path to new note>
- Cross-linked: <list of entity pages updated>
- Index updated: <which index.md files>
```

This pass runs AFTER the note is written and validated, not during writing.

**For raw/ captures:** Cross-linking is minimal (just add `compiled: false` frontmatter). The full cross-link pass happens during k2b-compile, which updates wiki pages.

## Pre-Write Validation (Safety Check)

Before writing or editing ANY vault note, run this checklist. Stop and fix issues before saving.

1. **Frontmatter completeness**: All required fields for the note type are present (tags, date, type, origin, up)
2. **Inbox contract**: If destination is `review/`, review-action and review-notes are present
3. **Folder placement**: File path matches the convention for its type (see File Locations table above)
4. **Wikilink integrity**: Use `mcp__obsidian__search` or Glob to verify each `[[target]]` exists. Create stubs for missing targets.
5. **MOC link**: `up:` points to a valid MOC that exists at vault root
6. **No em dashes**: Scan content for em dashes (--) and replace with double hyphens
7. **Date format**: `date:` field is YYYY-MM-DD

This is the "careful" pattern: validate before acting, not after.

## Quality Checklist

After writing, confirm:
- [ ] Frontmatter is valid YAML with all required fields
- [ ] Inbox notes have review-action and review-notes
- [ ] `up` link points to the correct MOC
- [ ] All `[[wikilinks]]` use correct file names (glob-verified)
- [ ] `date` field uses YYYY-MM-DD format
- [ ] No em dashes in the content
- [ ] File is saved in the correct folder
- [ ] `origin` field is set (keith, k2b-extract, or k2b-generate)
- [ ] Relevant MOC has been updated with a link to this note

## Usage Logging
