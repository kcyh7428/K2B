description: End-of-session shipping workflow -- runs Codex pre-commit review, commits, pushes, updates the feature note, updates wiki/concepts/index.md lane membership, appends DEVLOG.md and wiki/log.md, suggests next Backlog promotion, and reminds Keith to /sync. Use when Keith says /ship, "ship it", "wrap up", "end of session", "done shipping", or at the natural end of a build session where code was modified.

# K2B Ship

Keystone skill for shipping discipline. Replaces the manual Session Discipline checklist with an enforceable workflow that keeps `wiki/concepts/index.md` (the canonical roadmap) honest.

## When to Trigger

**Explicit:** Keith says `/ship`, "ship it", "ship this", "wrap up", "end of session", "done shipping", "close out", "commit and push this".

**Proactive prompt:** At the natural end of any session where K2B modified code in `.claude/skills/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `K2B_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `k2b-remote/`, `scripts/`, `k2b-dashboard/`, or a feature note moved into `in-progress` or `shipped` state -- say: "We have uncommitted changes in [list]. Want me to /ship?"

**Do NOT auto-ship.** Always confirm the commit message and the Codex findings before committing.

## When NOT to Use

- Vault-only changes (daily notes, review processing, content drafts) -- these sync via Syncthing, no commit needed
- Emergency hotfixes where Keith explicitly says "just commit, skip review"
- When the user is mid-implementation and just wants an interim checkpoint -- they should say `/commit` or commit manually

## Commands

- `/ship` -- full workflow with Codex review + feature note updates + roadmap updates
- `/ship --skip-codex <reason>` -- skip Codex review with a recorded reason (must provide reason)
- `/ship --no-feature` -- ship code without touching feature notes or the roadmap (e.g. typo fix, config tweak)
- `/ship status` -- show what would ship without actually shipping

## Workflow

### 0. Active rules auto-promotion scan

Before anything else, scan for learnings that have crossed the promotion threshold (reinforced 3x) and surface them to Keith for inline y/n/skip confirmation. This step runs on every `/ship` call, including `--no-feature` and `--defer` variants. It is read-only until Keith answers `y`.

Run:

```bash
scripts/promote-learnings.py
```

The scanner prints a JSON array of candidate learnings. Each candidate has: `learn_id`, `count`, `distilled_rule`, `source_excerpt`, `would_exceed_cap`, `current_active_count`, `cap`. If the array is empty, print `auto-promote: 0 candidates` and continue to step 1.

For each candidate, surface Keith inline:

```
L-<id> has been reinforced <count>x and is not in active_rules.
Distilled: "<distilled_rule>"
Promote now? [y/n/skip]
```

If `distilled_rule` is `null` (no frontmatter line, no bolded first sentence in the body), print the full `source_excerpt` first and ask Keith to supply the rule text inline before promoting. Save his answer as the rule text for the append step.

Act on Keith's answer:

- **y**: Append a new numbered rule to `active_rules.md` using the distilled rule text. Section placement is by topical fit (Identity, Vault, Deployment, Karpathy); if unsure, drop it in the section the source learning's `Area:` field maps to. Include `(<L-id>, last-reinforced: <today>)` in the parenthetical per the Fix #5 format.
  - **Before** appending, if `would_exceed_cap` is `true` OR the post-append rule count would exceed `cap`, resolve the LRU victim:
    ```bash
    scripts/select-lru-victim.py
    ```
    The helper reads `active_rules.md`, parses `last-reinforced:` and reinforcement count, and prints the oldest rule as JSON (`{"rule_number": N, "title": "...", "l_id": "...", "last_reinforced": "..."}`). Surface the demotion to Keith as `⚠ demoting rule <N> (<title>) to make room for <new rule>` and wait for his confirmation. On `y`, call:
    ```bash
    scripts/demote-rule.sh <N>
    ```
    which moves the rule block intact into `self_improve_learnings.md`'s `## Demoted Rules` section, renumbers the remaining rules contiguously, and logs via the Fix #1 helper. Only after the demotion returns success do you append the new rule.
- **n**: Append `auto-promote-rejected: true` to the learning's entry body in `self_improve_learnings.md` (as a bullet: `- **auto-promote-rejected:** true`) so the scanner skips it on future `/ship` runs. Do not modify the count.
- **skip**: Do nothing. The candidate will re-appear on the next `/ship`.

After all candidates are processed, log the net change via the Fix #1 helper:

```bash
scripts/wiki-log-append.sh /ship "step-0" "promoted=<N> rejected=<M> skipped=<K> demoted=<D>"
```

Then continue to step 1.

### 1. Scope detection

Run in parallel:

```bash
git status
git diff --stat
git log -5 --oneline
```

Categorize touched files into:

| Category | Matching paths | Needs /sync? |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| skills    | `.claude/skills/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `K2B_ARCHITECTURE.md` | yes |
| code      | `k2b-remote/` | yes (build + pm2 restart k2b-remote) |
| dashboard | `k2b-dashboard/` | yes (build + pm2 restart k2b-dashboard) |
| scripts   | `scripts/` including `scripts/hooks/` | yes |
| vault     | `K2B-Vault/` | no (Syncthing) |
| plans     | `.claude/plans/` | no |
| devlog    | `DEVLOG.md` | no |

**Category names must match `/sync`'s category table exactly.** `/sync` currently defines: `skills`, `code`, `dashboard`, `scripts`. Any category label that `/ship --defer` writes into a mailbox entry must be one of those four -- otherwise `/sync` would consume the entry without a deploy target, silently dropping the change. In particular, `scripts/hooks/**` rolls up into `scripts` (not a separate `hooks` category): the deploy script's `scripts` mode already rsyncs `scripts/` recursively, which covers hooks.

If there are NO changes at all, report "No changes to ship" and stop.

### 2. Identify the feature being shipped

Read `K2B-Vault/wiki/concepts/index.md`, find the **In Progress** lane.

- If exactly one feature is In Progress -> that is the candidate feature
- If zero features are In Progress -> ask Keith whether this ships under an existing Backlog feature (and if so, which), or is infrastructure work with no feature attached (`--no-feature`)
- If multiple features are In Progress (shouldn't happen per lane rules) -> ask Keith to disambiguate

For multi-ship features (e.g. `feature_mission-control-v3`), read the feature note's Shipping Status table. Identify the current ship row (`in-flight` / `in progress`). Ask Keith to confirm which ship this commit completes.

### 3. Codex pre-commit review gate

**Mandatory unless `--skip-codex <reason>` is passed.** This is **Checkpoint 2** of the two K2B adversarial review checkpoints. (Checkpoint 1 is **plan review** -- see below -- and runs earlier, before implementation. `/ship` only owns Checkpoint 2.)

```
/codex:review
```

on the uncommitted diff. Capture findings.

- Present findings neutrally to Keith. Do not argue with Codex. Let Keith decide.
- Keith decides: fix now, defer, or accept. If he fixes, re-run /codex:review on the new diff.
- Log the gate result: `reviewed / skipped:<reason>`, number of findings, fix verdict.

If Codex plugin is not configured: fail loudly with "Run `/codex:setup` or re-run with `/ship --skip-codex <reason>`."

### Codex Adversarial Review -- the two checkpoints

K2B uses OpenAI Codex (via the `/codex:` plugin) as a second-model reviewer to catch blind spots Claude cannot see in its own work. Two mandatory checkpoints bracket any non-trivial build:

**Checkpoint 1: Plan Review.** Before implementing any new feature, skill, or significant refactor, after the plan is written but before code is touched:

- Run `/codex:adversarial-review challenge the plan` with the plan file path
- Look for: over-engineering, simpler alternatives, missing edge cases, unnecessary complexity
- Adjust the plan based on findings BEFORE writing code

This checkpoint lives outside `/ship` -- it is the author's responsibility at plan-time. `/ship` only sees the result (the already-reviewed plan, or its absence) via the diff it is about to commit.

**Checkpoint 2: Pre-Commit Review.** Before committing changes from a build session, `/ship` runs `/codex:review` on the uncommitted diff (step 3 above). Look for: bugs, logic errors, drift from the plan, edge cases. Fix issues before committing.

**When Codex review can be skipped:**

- Vault-only changes (daily notes, review processing, content drafts)
- Config tweaks, typo fixes, one-line changes
- Emergency hotfixes where the bug-fix speed matters more than review (review after the fact)

**Never skip both checkpoints.** If Checkpoint 1 was skipped because the feature was small enough that no plan was written, Checkpoint 2 becomes mandatory. Conversely, if Checkpoint 2 is skipped via `/ship --skip-codex <reason>`, Checkpoint 1 must have run earlier in the session -- otherwise the build has had no adversarial review at all, and `/ship` should refuse to proceed without Keith's explicit override.

**Rules for presenting Codex findings to Keith:**

- Report findings neutrally. Do not argue with Codex.
- Do not pre-filter findings by "importance" before Keith sees them.
- Let Keith decide which to fix, defer, or accept.

### 4. Generate commit message

Build a commit message from the categorized diff. Format:

```
<type>: <short summary>

<optional body with bullet points of major changes>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `infra`. **Never use em dashes** (K2B rule).

Show Keith the draft. Confirm before committing.

### 5. Stage + commit + push

Stage every file this session touched, regardless of category. The category table in step 1 is for `/sync` routing decisions, not for gating staging -- a touched file in `docs/`, `allhands/`, or any other uncategorized path still gets staged if it belongs to this session. Files in the working tree that predate the session and were not touched in this session must NOT be staged.

```bash
# Stage only the files we know about -- no git add -A (active rule: sensitive file avoidance)
git add <each file this session touched, from step 1 git status>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<message from step 4>
EOF
)"
git push origin main
```

Never pass `--no-verify`. Never pass `--amend` unless Keith explicitly asked. If pre-commit hooks fail, fix the underlying issue and create a NEW commit.

Capture the commit SHA.

### 6. Update the feature note

If `--no-feature` was passed, skip this step.

Read the feature note at `K2B-Vault/wiki/concepts/feature_<slug>.md`.

**Single-ship feature (no Shipping Status table):**
- Update frontmatter: `status: shipped`, add `shipped-date: YYYY-MM-DD`
- Append an `## Updates` section entry with: date, commit SHA, one-line what shipped, Codex findings summary, any follow-ups
- Move the file to `K2B-Vault/wiki/concepts/Shipped/feature_<slug>.md`

**Multi-ship feature (has Shipping Status table, e.g. mission-control-v3):**
- Do NOT set the top-level `status: shipped` -- only the current ship is done
- Update the Shipping Status table row for the current ship: mark `shipped: YYYY-MM-DD`, set `state: in-measurement` (or `state: gate-passed` if no measurement window), set gate date if applicable
- Append an `## Updates` entry with ship details, commit SHA, Codex findings
- If this was the final ship in the plan AND it has passed its gate, THEN set feature-level `status: shipped` and move to `Shipped/`. Otherwise leave in place.

### 7. Update `wiki/concepts/index.md`

Load the index, locate the feature's row, move it between lanes:

- **Single-ship feature shipped:** Remove from In Progress, add to Shipped with `shipped-date`. If Shipped now has more than 10 rows, move the oldest one's wiki-link target file into `Shipped/` (update its `up:` still points to `[[index]]`, but the wiki-link in the index now references `Shipped/feature_<slug>`).
- **Multi-ship feature, ship complete but feature not done:** Update In Progress row to show the new ship state (`Ship N (in measurement, gate YYYY-MM-DD)`). Do not move.
- **Multi-ship feature, final ship complete and gate passed:** Move to Shipped lane as above.

Also update `Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD` at top of index.

### 8. Append DEVLOG.md and create follow-up commit

`DEVLOG.md` is tracked in git at project root, so appending to it creates dirty state that must be committed. Because the entry needs to reference the code commit's SHA (captured in step 5), this is always a two-commit flow: code first, devlog second.

Read the last DEVLOG entry for style. Append a new entry:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD -- <one-line title>

**Commit:** `<short-sha>` <commit message title>

**What shipped:** <one paragraph>

**Codex review:** <findings summary or "skipped: <reason>">

**Feature status change:** <feature slug> <status-from> -> <status-to>

**Follow-ups:** <bullets, or "none">

**Key decisions (if divergent from claude.ai project specs):** <bullets, or "none">
```

Then commit and push as a standalone devlog commit (matches the repo's existing pattern, e.g. `dc2ba69 docs: devlog for active rules staleness detection`):

```bash
git add DEVLOG.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs: devlog for <short-sha>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
git push origin main
```

Never `--amend` the step-5 commit to include DEVLOG.md -- amends rewrite history and can drop signed state. Always create a new commit.

If shipping multiple logical changes in one session (two or more code commits back-to-back), batch all their DEVLOG entries into a single follow-up `docs: devlog` commit after the last code commit, referencing each code SHA in its own entry.

### 9. Append wiki/log.md

Call the single-writer helper (never append to wiki/log.md directly):

```bash
scripts/wiki-log-append.sh /ship "<feature-slug>" "shipped <feature-slug>: <one-line-summary>"
```

Replace `<feature-slug>` with the feature note basename (e.g. `feature_k2b-ship`) and `<one-line-summary>` with the same text used in the commit message subject. Helper handles locking, timestamp, and format.

### 10. Multi-ship gate handling

If the feature has a Shipping Status table and this ship has a gate scheduled (per minimax-offload phase gate pattern):

- Remind Keith: "Ship X of Y done. Gate review scheduled for YYYY-MM-DD. Nothing else should start on Ship X+1 until the gate passes."
- Offer to create a scheduled task via `/schedule` if the gate review is not already scheduled: the task should run `/observe` and the phase gate checklist from the feature note, then Telegram Keith the go/no-go summary.

### 11. Promote next Backlog item to Next Up (only for single-ship ships or final-ship ships)

If the just-shipped feature was removed from In Progress (leaving In Progress empty):

- Read Next Up lane. Count items.
- If Next Up has fewer than 3 items, look at the top of Backlog (sorted by priority then effort).
- Suggest to Keith: "Backlog top candidate: `feature_X`. Promote to Next Up? [Y/n]"
- On Y: move the row from Backlog to Next Up in `wiki/concepts/index.md`, ask Keith for a "Why now" reason for the Next Up table.
- **Never auto-promote.** Always require explicit confirmation.

### 12. Deployment handoff -- explicit sync-now or defer

If any files in categories `skills`, `code`, `dashboard`, or `scripts` were in the commits, the Mac Mini is now out of date with the pushed code. (`scripts/hooks/**` rolls up into `scripts` -- do not write a separate `hooks` category into mailbox entries, `/sync` has no deploy target for it and would silently drop the change.) A soft reminder is not enough because it can be missed and leaves no recovery signal. Ask Keith an explicit question:

> Project files changed (list the categories + files). Run `/sync` now, or defer to a later session?
> - **now** -- invoke `/sync` in-line, confirm it completed, done
> - **defer** -- drop a new entry in the `.pending-sync/` mailbox so the next session (or the next `/sync`) catches up

**If Keith picks `now`:**
1. Invoke the `k2b-sync` skill via the Skill tool (or run `~/Projects/K2B/scripts/deploy-to-mini.sh auto` if skill invocation is unavailable in the current harness).
2. Report what was synced.
3. **Do NOT touch the `.pending-sync/` mailbox.** `/sync` is the sole owner of the mailbox lifecycle. It consumes and deletes its own entries on success. Any cleanup `/ship` did after-the-fact would race with a concurrent `/ship --defer` in another session and could silently destroy a newer deferred entry. Leave the mailbox alone.

**If Keith picks `defer`:**

1. Write a **new unique entry** in the `~/Projects/K2B/.pending-sync/` mailbox directory. Each defer creates its own file -- we never rewrite an existing file -- so concurrent defers from other sessions cannot race. Write via temp-file + `os.replace()` so a crash mid-write cannot leave partial JSON that downstream readers would flag as UNREADABLE:

   ```bash
   python3 <<PYEOF
   import json, os, datetime, tempfile, uuid
   dir_ = os.path.expanduser("~/Projects/K2B/.pending-sync")
   os.makedirs(dir_, exist_ok=True)

   now = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)
   entry_id = f"{now.strftime('%Y%m%dT%H%M%S')}_<short-sha from step 5>_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"
   final_path = os.path.join(dir_, f"{entry_id}.json")

   payload = {
     "pending": True,
     "set_at": now.isoformat(),
     "set_by_commit": "<short-sha from step 5>",
     "categories": ["<list from above>"],
     "files": ["<list from step 1>"],
     "entry_id": entry_id,
   }

   # Atomic write: temp file in the SAME directory, then os.replace into final name.
   # Temp names start with '.tmp_' so mailbox readers know to ignore in-progress writes.
   fd, tmp = tempfile.mkstemp(prefix=".tmp_", suffix=".json", dir=dir_)
   try:
       with os.fdopen(fd, "w") as f:
           json.dump(payload, f, indent=2)
           f.flush()
           os.fsync(f.fileno())
       os.replace(tmp, final_path)
   except Exception:
       try: os.unlink(tmp)
       except FileNotFoundError: pass
       raise
   PYEOF
   ```

   Required schema fields: `pending` (bool, must be `true` for an active entry), `set_at` (ISO-8601 UTC timestamp), `set_by_commit` (short SHA from step 5), `categories` (list of strings matching the category table), `files` (list of file paths relative to `~/Projects/K2B/`), and `entry_id` (matches the filename stem for traceability). `k2b-sync`'s Step 0 validates these fields and fails loud if any are missing.

2. Tell Keith: "Deferred. Entry `<entry_id>` added to `.pending-sync/` mailbox. Next session's startup hook will surface pending mailbox entries, and any later `/sync` invocation will consume them before checking conversation context."

3. The mailbox directory is gitignored (`/.pending-sync/` in `.gitignore`), never propagates to the Mini, and survives session boundaries on the MacBook only. **Consuming and deleting mailbox entries is `/sync`'s exclusive responsibility**, and it only deletes the specific entries it actually processed -- a `/ship --defer` running concurrently writes to a different filename, so nothing can be clobbered.

**Race-safety invariant:** The mailbox is a multi-producer / single-consumer queue where each producer writes a unique filename. Producers (`/ship --defer`) never read or delete. The consumer (`/sync`) deletes only filenames it has observed and processed. No state is ever rewritten in place. This makes the lifecycle race-free on POSIX without locks.

**If no syncable files changed:** Skip the question entirely. Do not write a marker. Report "Nothing to sync -- all changes were vault/plan/devlog only."

Do NOT auto-sync without asking. Per Active Rule L-2026-03-29-002, never run manual rsync -- always go through the deploy script via `/sync` or `k2b-sync`.

### 13. Usage logging

```bash
echo -e "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\tk2b-ship\t$(echo $RANDOM | md5sum | head -c 8)\tshipped FEATURE_SLUG SHORT_SHA" >> ~/Projects/K2B-Vault/wiki/context/skill-usage-log.tsv
```

## Error Handling

- **Pre-commit hook fails** -> fix the underlying issue (per Active Rule 8, never `--no-verify`), re-stage, create a NEW commit (never `--amend`).
- **Push fails (not a force-push scenario)** -> investigate. Fetch, check if the branch diverged, ask Keith how to reconcile.
- **Codex plugin missing** -> loud failure with next-step instruction; do not silently skip.
- **Feature note not found** -> ask Keith which feature this belongs to, or offer to ship as `--no-feature`.
- **`wiki/concepts/index.md` parse failure** -> fail loudly, point Keith at the file, do not guess the lane structure.
- **DEVLOG.md / wiki/log.md append failure** -> commit has already landed, so degrade gracefully: print the entry Keith should add manually, continue with the rest of the workflow.

## What /ship Does NOT Do

- Auto-sync to Mac Mini (Keith must run `/sync` explicitly)
- Edit vault files other than the feature note, `wiki/concepts/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`, `DEVLOG.md`, and the skill-usage-log
- Overwrite `store/` (production SQLite on Mac Mini)
- Touch `.env` files
- Force-push, amend existing commits, rebase, or use any destructive git operation
- Run deployment scripts

## Notes

- `/ship` is intentional, not a hook. Shipping is a human-in-the-loop action.
- The Codex pre-commit review gate is mandatory per CLAUDE.md. Skipping requires a recorded reason.
- `wiki/concepts/index.md` is the source of truth. `/ship` is how state transitions get written safely -- never edit lane membership by hand mid-session.
- For multi-ship features, the Shipping Status table and phase gate pattern (modeled on `project_minimax-offload`) stay authoritative. `/ship` updates rows within it; it does not replace the table.
- `/ship --no-feature` is the escape hatch for infrastructure commits that don't map to a feature (e.g. fixing CI, rotating a credential). Use sparingly.
