## 2026-03-31 -- YouTube Taste Learning Loop + Vault Housekeeping

### 1. Features/Shipped subfolder convention
- Created `Notes/Features/Shipped/` for completed feature specs (distinct from Archive)
- Added "Roadmap & Feature Notes" section to CLAUDE.md: Roadmap MOC = index, feature notes = detailed specs only when needed
- Moved ai-human-guardrail, proactive-youtube, playlist-redesign to Shipped

### 2. YouTube taste learning loop
- Added skip-why buttons to Telegram: [Too basic] [Clickbait] [Not relevant] [Too long]
- Added value-feedback buttons after highlights: [Exactly my level] [Gave me an idea] [Good but basic] [Not worth it]
- New `appendFeedbackSignal()` in youtube.ts writes to `youtube-feedback-signals.jsonl`
- Extended `YouTubeRecommendation` interface: topics, skip_reason, value_signal, search_query
- Updated observer-prompt.md with YouTube Taste Synthesis section (generates youtube_taste object)
- Updated observer-loop.sh to write `youtube-taste-profile.md` when taste data present
- Updated SKILL.md: recommend workflow now reads taste profile, 5-dimension scoring with confidence-weighted taste fit
- Scheduled `/youtube recommend` every other day at 11am HKT

### 3. Scheduled tasks wiped (again) and restored
- Manual rsync overwrote Mac Mini production SQLite database (SAME bug as E-2026-03-29-002)
- Restored all 5 original tasks + added new youtube recommend task (6 total)
- Logged as E-2026-03-31-001, reinforced L-2026-03-29-002 to 3x (medium confidence)
- Rule: NEVER manual rsync for k2b-remote. ALWAYS use `scripts/deploy-to-mini.sh code`

### 4. Agent SDK systemPrompt 403 fix
- Uncommitted agent.ts changes (systemPrompt preset/append) were synced to Mac Mini for the first time
- SDK 0.1.77 doesn't support systemPrompt config -- caused 403 Forbidden on all agent calls
- Reverted systemPrompt block, redeployed via deploy-to-mini.sh (not manual rsync)

### 5. SSH Keychain limitation documented
- macOS Keychain blocks credential access from non-interactive SSH sessions
- Claude CLI auth works interactively on Mac Mini but fails via SSH
- All pm2-based paths (Telegram, scheduled tasks) work fine -- only direct SSH agent invocation affected
- Documented in project_k2b-always-on.md Known Issues

**Key decisions:**
- Taste profile starts permissive (weight 0.15 at low confidence) and tightens as signals accumulate (0.30 at high confidence)
- No hard filtering -- taste scores are soft ranking adjustments, never exclusions
- Feedback buttons are optional -- ignoring them still records the skip/watch as a signal
- deploy-to-mini.sh is the ONLY acceptable way to deploy k2b-remote code

## 2026-03-30 -- Tailscale Remote Access + Proxy Support for System Proxy Mode

**What was built/changed:**

### 1. Proxy Support for k2b-remote
- Installed `https-proxy-agent` for Grammy bot proxy routing
- Wired proxy into Grammy bot constructor (`bot.ts`) via `client.baseFetchConfig.agent` -- only activates when `HTTP_PROXY` env var is set
- Wired proxy into Agent SDK (`agent.ts`) via `options.env` passing `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` to Claude Code subprocess
- Added `HTTP_PROXY` config to `config.ts` with fallback chain: `.env` file -> `process.env`
- Created `ecosystem.config.cjs` locally (was previously Mac Mini only) with proxy env vars defaulting to port 7897

### 2. Mac Mini Network Mode Change
- Switched Mac Mini Clash Verge from TUN mode to System Proxy mode (port 7897)
- Added `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY` to Mac Mini `~/.zshenv` for all CLI tools (gws, curl, etc.)
- Restarted observer loop with proxy env vars (curl in minimax-common.sh needs proxy)
- All external APIs verified working through proxy: Telegram, Anthropic, Groq, MiniMax, Google

### 3. Tailscale Mesh Networking
- Installed Tailscale standalone on Mac Mini (IP: `100.116.205.17`, full mode)
- Installed Tailscale standalone on MacBook (IP: `100.68.35.19`, full mode)
- No TUN conflict on Mac Mini (System Proxy mode) or MacBook (Tailscale coexists with Clash TUN)
- Added `macmini-ts` SSH alias in `~/.ssh/config` for remote access via Tailscale
- Tested from mobile hotspot (different network) -- SSH works

### 4. Vault Documentation
- Updated `project_k2b-always-on.md` with Phase 7 (Tailscale + proxy), updated specs table, known issues, operational commands
- Updated `MOC_K2B-System.md` architecture diagram with Tailscale IPs and proxy details
- Updated TLDR action items (3 of 4 remote gaps now resolved)
- Updated Mac Mini memory reference with Tailscale and proxy info

**Key decisions:**
- Mac Mini uses System Proxy (not TUN) so Tailscale can run in full mode as SSH target
- MacBook keeps TUN mode (Claude Desktop requires it) -- Tailscale works alongside it
- Proxy wiring is conditional: code works identically with or without `HTTP_PROXY` set
- Port 7897 (not 7890) is Clash Verge's default on the Mac Mini

**Learnings captured:** L-2026-03-30-003 through L-2026-03-30-008 (Grammy restart after mode change, config.ts env source, port mismatch, proxy wiring architecture, Tailscale+Clash compatibility, all-processes-need-proxy)

## 2026-03-30 -- Claude Code Hooks, MiniMax Background Observer, Proactive YouTube

**What was built/changed:**

### 1. Claude Code Hooks (inspired by Everything Claude Code repo)
- Created `scripts/hooks/session-start.sh` -- deterministic session startup (usage triggers, inbox scan, observer candidates, high-confidence learnings)
- Created `scripts/hooks/stop-observe.sh` -- captures vault file changes after every Claude response to `observations.jsonl`
- Created `.claude/settings.json` -- project-level hooks config wiring both hooks

### 2. MiniMax Background Observer
- Created `scripts/observer-loop.sh` -- background process calling MiniMax-M2.5 API to analyze K2B usage patterns (~$0.007/analysis)
- Created `scripts/observer-prompt.md` -- structured analysis prompt (skill patterns, revision patterns, YouTube behavior)
- Fixed `scripts/minimax-common.sh` -- platform-aware vault path detection (MacBook vs Mac Mini)
- Deployed to Mac Mini as pm2 process `k2b-observer-loop`
- Gate: 20+ observations, 1hr cooldown, 7am-11pm HKT active hours

### 3. Confidence-Scored Learnings
- Updated `k2b-feedback` skill -- learnings now carry low/medium/high confidence based on reinforcement count
- Session-start hook auto-loads high-confidence (6+) learnings into context

### 4. Proactive YouTube Knowledge Acquisition
- Created `k2b-remote/src/youtube.ts` -- JSONL data layer for recommendation tracking + dedup
- Added Telegram inline keyboard buttons to `bot.ts` -- [Get highlights] [Skip] + promotion flow [Content idea] [Feature] [Insight] [Nothing]
- Added `callback_query:data` handler for all YouTube button interactions
- Added `/youtube morning` subcommand to k2b-youtube-capture skill
- Wired `sendPendingNudges` into scheduler.ts -- buttons sent after morning task completes
- Created scheduled task: daily 7am HKT `Run /youtube morning`
- Observer prompt updated to analyze YouTube watch/skip/promote patterns

### 5. Documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md -- hooks, observer loop, Mac Mini pm2 processes, /youtube morning
- Updated README.md -- full architecture diagram, skills table, self-improvement loop, tech stack
- Updated vault: Home.md, MOC_K2B-Roadmap.md, project_k2b.md, new feature_background-observer.md
- Created spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-29-proactive-youtube-knowledge-acquisition-design.md`
- Created plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-03-29-proactive-youtube-knowledge-acquisition.md`

**Key decisions:**
- MiniMax-M2.5 (minimaxi.com, $0.30/M in) chosen over Claude Haiku for background observer -- cheaper, Keith's existing subscription is underused
- Vault JSONL over SQLite for YouTube tracking -- observer needs to read the data, SQLite is opaque to it
- Extended existing k2b-youtube-capture skill rather than creating new k2b-youtube-morning skill -- one skill, cleaner
- Inline Telegram buttons via Grammy InlineKeyboard rather than text-based replies -- better UX

**Files affected:**
- `.claude/settings.json` -- new (hooks config)
- `.claude/skills/k2b-feedback/SKILL.md` -- confidence scoring
- `.claude/skills/k2b-observer/SKILL.md` -- background observer integration
- `.claude/skills/k2b-youtube-capture/SKILL.md` -- /youtube morning subcommand
- `k2b-remote/src/bot.ts` -- inline buttons, callback handler, sendPendingNudges
- `k2b-remote/src/scheduler.ts` -- post-task nudge sending
- `k2b-remote/src/youtube.ts` -- new (JSONL data layer)
- `scripts/hooks/session-start.sh` -- new
- `scripts/hooks/stop-observe.sh` -- new
- `scripts/observer-loop.sh` -- new
- `scripts/observer-prompt.md` -- new + YouTube patterns
- `scripts/minimax-common.sh` -- platform-aware vault path
- `CLAUDE.md` -- hooks, observer, youtube morning docs
- `README.md` -- comprehensive rewrite

## 2026-03-29 -- Git Setup & Session Discipline

**What was built/changed:**
- Updated root .gitignore with comprehensive ignore rules (secrets, node_modules, dist, store, workspace/uploads, logs, pids)
- Created DEVLOG.md with standard entry template
- Added "Session Discipline" section to CLAUDE.md enforcing end-of-session commits and devlog entries
- Committed all previously uncommitted work: 12 new skills, vault-writer references, scripts, migration-exports, k2b-remote health endpoint, MCP config

**Files affected:**
- `.gitignore` -- expanded from 2 rules to full coverage
- `DEVLOG.md` -- created
- `CLAUDE.md` -- added Session Discipline section
- `.claude/skills/k2b-email/` -- new skill
- `.claude/skills/k2b-feedback/` -- new skill (replaces k2b-learn, k2b-error, k2b-request)
- `.claude/skills/k2b-inbox/` -- new skill
- `.claude/skills/k2b-linkedin/` -- new skill
- `.claude/skills/k2b-media-generator/` -- new skill
- `.claude/skills/k2b-observer/` -- new skill
- `.claude/skills/k2b-scheduler/` -- new skill
- `.claude/skills/k2b-sync/` -- new skill
- `.claude/skills/k2b-usage-tracker/` -- new skill
- `.claude/skills/k2b-youtube-capture/` -- new skill
- `.claude/skills/k2b-vault-writer/references/` -- Obsidian syntax references (moved from deleted obsidian-markdown skill)
- `scripts/` -- deploy, LinkedIn, MiniMax, YouTube helper scripts
- `k2b-remote/src/health.ts` -- new health endpoint
- `k2b-remote/scripts/health-check.sh` -- health check script
- `migration-exports/` -- Claude conversation exports for data migration

**Key decisions:**
- Single root .gitignore covers the whole project; k2b-remote keeps its own .gitignore for subdir-specific rules
- migration-exports/ included in repo (reference material, no secrets)
- obsidian-markdown skill deleted; its references moved under k2b-vault-writer
- k2b-learn, k2b-error, k2b-request consolidated into k2b-feedback

**Status:**
- What works: Git repo with full history, all skills and code tracked
- What's incomplete: Nothing -- this is a housekeeping commit
- What's next: Normal development with session-end commit discipline
