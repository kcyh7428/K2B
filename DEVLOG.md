## 2026-04-08 -- Vault redesign Plan A: remaining 5 skill alignment

**What**: Updated the 5 remaining skills deferred from the previous session to align with the new vault architecture (auto-promote, index updates, cross-link pass, System/log.md).

**Shipped**:
- meeting-processor: output path fixed from Notes/ to Notes/Work/, added post-write contract (index + log), added up: frontmatter
- daily-capture: TLDR source updated for decompose-immediately, auto-promote awareness section, vault-writer reference
- inbox: narrowed scope description (content-ideas + LinkedIn drafts only), updated promote destinations with misroute flags, index update on promote
- linkedin: vault redesign exception note for drafts staying in Inbox, index/log updates on publish
- insight-extractor: insights marked as auto-promote, post-write contract for both /insight and /content outputs

**Key decisions**:
- LinkedIn drafts remain in Inbox/ as an explicit exception to the content-ideas-only rule (they need Keith's approval before publishing)
- Non-content types in the inbox promote table are flagged as "misrouted" to catch routing bugs

**Still needs**:
- Weekly /lint schedule not yet configured
- Plan B (compiled wiki) designed but deferred

**Files changed**: k2b-meeting-processor/SKILL.md, k2b-daily-capture/SKILL.md, k2b-inbox/SKILL.md, k2b-linkedin/SKILL.md, k2b-insight-extractor/SKILL.md

---

## 2026-04-07 -- Vault redesign Plan A: Karpathy architecture adoption

**What**: Researched Karpathy's LLM Wiki architecture, designed two-track plan (Plan A incremental + Plan B compiled wiki), shipped Plan A, cleared inbox from 14 to 0, audited all 19 skills.

**Key decisions**:
- Karpathy's compilation model supersedes Cole's 5-layer framework as vault design reference
- Plan A first (low risk), Plan B later if needed (compilation engine)
- Compile step will be summary-first (Keith approves before ripple) when Plan B ships
- MOCs will merge into wiki/index.md hierarchy in Plan B

**Shipped**:
- Per-folder index.md (8 files across Notes/ subfolders)
- System/log.md (append-only vault activity record)
- k2b-lint skill (new /lint command, subsumes feature_vault-housekeeping-agent)
- Auto-promote routing in vault-writer (captures bypass Inbox by type)
- Cross-link pass contract in vault-writer
- Inbox narrowed to k2b-generate content ideas only
- 4 capture skills updated (youtube-capture, research, tldr, CLAUDE.md)
- Inbox cleared: 7 YouTube notes consolidated, 2 research briefings consolidated, stabilization audit updated, feature idea moved

**Still needs**:
- 5 skills need alignment updates: meeting-processor, daily-capture, inbox, linkedin, insight-extractor
- Weekly /lint schedule not yet configured
- Plan B (compiled wiki) designed but deferred 1-2 weeks

**Files changed**: k2b-lint/SKILL.md (new), k2b-vault-writer/SKILL.md, k2b-youtube-capture/SKILL.md, k2b-research/SKILL.md, k2b-tldr/SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md

---

## 2026-04-05 -- Memory sync architecture fix (symlink to vault)

**What was built/changed:**
- Fixed memory drift between MacBook and Mac Mini: Claude Code memory dir `~/.claude/projects/-Users-{user}-Projects-K2B/memory/` is machine-local and doesn't sync via Syncthing or /sync
- Weekly promotion task (Sunday 10am HKT) ran on Mac Mini and created a fresh active_rules.md with only 2 rules, while MacBook had 12 rules -- Telegram-K2B was missing 10 behavioral rules
- Solution: symlink the machine-local memory dir to `K2B-Vault/System/memory/` on both machines
- Moved all 13 memory files to `K2B-Vault/System/memory/`
- Replaced machine-local memory dirs with symlinks pointing to vault location
- Syncthing now handles memory sync automatically
- Zero code changes: session-start hook's `find` command follows symlinks transparently
- Deleted backup directories after verifying both machines read correctly through symlinks

**Files affected:**
- K2B-Vault/System/memory/ (new canonical location, 13 files)
- ~/.claude/projects/-Users-keithmbpm2-Projects-K2B/memory (now symlink)
- ~/.claude/projects/-Users-fastshower-Projects-K2B/memory (now symlink, on Mac Mini)
- CLAUDE.md (documented memory sync architecture)
- K2B-Vault/System/memory/reference_mac_mini.md (documented symlink setup)

**Key decisions:**
- Symlink approach chosen over moving files + updating hook paths: zero code changes, works for MEMORY.md auto-loading by Claude Code harness
- Memory files live in vault under `System/` (non-standard folder to discourage accidental Obsidian edits)
- Scheduled tasks on either machine now write to the shared location automatically
- Architecture supports future machines: just create a symlink from their machine-local path to the vault

## 2026-04-04 -- Redesign /daily from blank template to multi-turn compilation

**What was built/changed:**
- Full rewrite of k2b-daily-capture SKILL.md -- flipped from "blank morning template" to "end-of-day compilation from existing captures"
- New model: K2B harvests Telegram messages (via SSH to Mac Mini SQLite), vault notes created today, TLDRs, and yesterday's open loops, then classifies into context sections and refines through conversation
- Sections are dynamic: SJM Work, Signhub/TalentSignals/Agency at Scale, K2B Build, Insights, Content Seeds, Open Loops -- only rendered if they have content
- Morning mode: brief open-loops-only view, not a full template
- Channel-aware: full preview on terminal, compact summary on Telegram
- Multi-turn conversation flow: harvest -> draft -> ask about gaps -> Keith refines -> save
- Simplified daily-note.md template (vault) -- removed blank prompts, now just frontmatter + dynamic section comments
- New eval.json with 4 test cases: mixed Telegram classification, quiet day, morning mode, all-Telegram with voice notes

**Files affected:**
- .claude/skills/k2b-daily-capture/SKILL.md (full rewrite)
- .claude/skills/k2b-daily-capture/eval/eval.json (4 new test cases)
- K2B-Vault/Templates/daily-note.md (simplified)

**Key decisions:**
- /daily is a conversation, not a one-shot generator. K2B asks clarifying questions before saving.
- Git log excluded from K2B Build section -- /daily captures the day as an executive, not a changelog
- Telegram messages are mixed across all contexts (SJM, side ventures, personal) -- skill must classify, not assume
- Design originated from Keith's Claude Chat spec, refined through discussion about message classification and iterative flow

---

## 2026-04-04 -- Stabilization audit, memory layer fix, inbox processing

**What was built/changed:**
- Full K2B stabilization audit comparing architecture against Cole Medin's second brain framework
- Audit covers: architecture health (5 layers), recurring friction analysis (30+ learnings categorized), skill-by-skill status (18 skills), k2b-remote health, config parity, reference implementation comparison
- Fixed memory layer: split learnings into two tiers -- active_rules.md (12 distilled behavioral rules, loaded every session) + self_improve_learnings.md (historical reference, not loaded at startup)
- Session-start hook rewritten to load active_rules.md instead of broken reinforcement threshold filter (was >= 6, max in file was 3, so zero learnings ever surfaced)
- Weekly memory promotion task scheduled (Sunday 10am HKT) -- reviews new learnings + observer candidates, updates active rules, prunes stale rules
- Fixed Telegram bot skip confirmation: "Skipped. Why?" -> "Skipped and removed from Watch playlist. Why?" (UX clarity)
- Updated settings.json permission allowlist: added ~20 missing bash commands, fixed MCP tool names to actual IDs, added all MCP servers
- Processed 3 inbox items (1 deleted, 2 archived with review-notes for observer)
- Captured learning L-2026-04-04-001: "shipped != finished" -- features aren't done until config surface is complete

**Files affected:**
- scripts/hooks/session-start.sh (active_rules.md loading replaces broken filter)
- .claude/settings.json (permission allowlist expanded + MCP names fixed)
- k2b-remote/src/bot.ts (skip confirmation message)
- memory/active_rules.md (new -- 12 distilled rules)
- memory/MEMORY.md (index updated)
- memory/self_improve_learnings.md (new learning added)
- K2B-Vault/Inbox/2026-04-04_k2b-stabilization-audit.md (new audit note)
- K2B-Vault/Notes/Context/preference-signals.jsonl (3 new signals)
- K2B-Vault/Notes/Context/self-improve-errors.jsonl (1 new error logged)

**Key decisions:**
- Memory layer follows capture -> distill -> apply -> prune loop (inspired by Cole Medin's daily reflection pattern)
- Active rules capped at ~15 entries to stay concise and always-loaded
- Audit is findings-only, no prescriptions -- Keith reviews and decides what to act on
- Mac Mini settings.json still needs the updated permissions (noted as config drift in audit)

---

## 2026-04-02 -- Slim CLAUDE.md from 268 to 161 lines

**What was built/changed:**
- Slimmed CLAUDE.md by removing skill-specific detail that's duplicated in SKILL.md files (loaded on-demand)
- Removed: Skill Data Flow ASCII diagram, detailed /inbox workflow, /observe subcommand descriptions, Mac Mini deploy commands, Background Observer implementation details
- Compressed: Slash commands to one-liners, vault structure tree, content pipeline, file conventions
- All behavioral rules preserved intact
- Synced to Mac Mini
- Logged feature request R-2026-04-02-001: observer should harvest review-notes from archived items

**Files affected:**
- CLAUDE.md (268 -> 161 lines, ~40% reduction)

**Key decisions:**
- Pure subtraction approach: no skill files needed editing since all removed detail already existed in corresponding SKILL.md files
- Inbox Write Contract rule relocated from Skill Data Flow section to Vault Structure section

**Status:**
- What works: All behavioral rules intact, slimmed file synced to Mac Mini
- What's next: Smoke test in fresh session to confirm skill routing still works with compressed slash command descriptions

---

## 2026-04-02 -- YouTube Telegram Button Fixes + /youtube screen

**Problem**: YouTube morning routine and recommend commands sent plain text to Telegram instead of inline keyboard button cards. Keith never saw Watch/Comment/Skip/Screen buttons for recommended videos.

**Root causes found**:
1. `sentNudgeIds` was an in-memory `Set` that never cleared -- once a video's nudge was sent, it was blocked forever (until pm2 restart). Changed to `Map<string, number>` with 24h TTL.
2. `/youtube recommend` skill didn't set `status: "nudge_sent"` in JSONL entries, so `getPendingNudges()` couldn't find new recommendations.
3. Screen button callback set `status: "processed"` instead of `screen_pending`, making videos invisible to the new screen command.
4. Scheduler only triggered nudge buttons after `/youtube morning`, not `/youtube recommend`.

**New feature**: `/youtube screen` command with Telegram button cards
- Polls K2B Screen playlist, writes `screen_pending` entries to JSONL
- Bot sends individual cards with Process/Skip buttons per video
- Process All button for batch processing
- Immediate acknowledgment message when processing starts (can take minutes for transcript extraction)
- Removed Screen processing from morning routine -- now on-demand only via `/youtube screen`

**Key decisions**:
- K2B Watch is exclusively populated by `/youtube recommend` -- Keith never adds there manually
- Keith's manual video additions go to K2B Screen
- Morning routine is lean: just stale nudge handling, no Screen processing
- Screen button cards follow same UX pattern as Watch nudge cards

---

## 2026-04-01 -- Mission Control v2

Major dashboard overhaul: from status board to command center.

### What was built

**New panels (Wave 1-2)**
- Health & Alerts strip -- checks pm2, inbox age, task failures. Green "nominal" or colored alert bar
- Suggested Next Action -- priority-ranked "what should I do?" card. Click copies command
- Quick Actions bar -- 5 preset buttons (/daily, /inbox, /content, /sync, /observe) + custom command input
- Vault Growth chart -- 30-day bar chart of notes created per day (+134 notes in period)
- LinkedIn Performance placeholder -- ready for metrics when API connected

**YouTube Digest redesigned**
- Response badges: Watch (green), Screen (blue), Skip (gray), Comment (amber), Pending (dashed)
- Verdict value labels (HIGH/MED/LOW) from two-pass pipeline
- Screening Pipeline: pending extraction + recently extracted (successful only)
- Skipped count collapsed to footer. Old Watch/Skip buttons removed

**Inbox redesigned**
- Filter tabs: All | Videos | Research | Features with counts
- Inline Snooze/Archive action buttons per item (POST /api/inbox/:filename/action)
- Accordion preview on click (200-char excerpt)
- Age-based urgency: amber 2d+, red 5d+, sorted oldest-first

**Improved existing panels**
- Activity Feed: collapsible time blocks (This morning/afternoon/Yesterday)
- Scheduled Tasks: status dots (green/red/gray) + per-task next run countdown
- Skills: Never Used collapsed into accordion with descriptions and try hints
- Intelligence: Observer hidden when empty, learnings capped at 3 with expand
- Content Pipeline: color-coded stage dots

**New API endpoints**
- GET /api/health -- system alert aggregation
- GET /api/vault/growth -- 30-day notes/day (cached 5m)
- GET /api/suggested-action -- composite next-action recommendation
- POST /api/command -- command relay (v1: clipboard copy)
- POST /api/inbox/:filename/action -- archive/snooze inbox items

### Key decisions
- Quick Actions copies to clipboard in v1 (not direct execution) -- avoids auth complexity
- Suggested Action shows only highest-priority item -- one line, one action
- Vault growth uses file birthtime not frontmatter date -- more reliable
- YouTube shows last 7 recs newest-first with click-to-expand pick_reason

### Files changed
- 11 modified components, 5 new components, 5 new server routes, 570+ lines CSS
- launch.json updated with mission-control preview config

## 2026-04-01 -- Two-Pass YouTube Recommendation Pipeline

Upgraded `/youtube recommend` from metadata-only scoring to transcript-screened verdicts with a closed learning loop.

### What was built
- **Two-pass recommend pipeline**: Pass 1 filters 24-40 candidates by metadata + preference profile, Pass 2 screens 5-7 finalists via transcript excerpts generating 3-5 sentence verdicts with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW value estimates
- **4-button Telegram layout**: Watch (logs + sends link), Comment (captures text/voice), Skip (logs + optional reason), Screen (sends to K2B Screen playlist for full processing)
- **Comment capture system**: `awaitingComment` Map in bot.ts intercepts next text or voice message after Comment/Skip buttons
- **youtube-preference-profile.md**: New vault file maintained by observer, read by recommend Pass 1. Tracks channel affinity, pillar patterns, duration preferences, verdict accuracy, machine-readable scoring adjustments
- **Observer extension**: Phase 1e harvests YouTube signals from recommended.jsonl + feedback-signals.jsonl. Phase 3b synthesizes youtube-preference-profile.md
- **Morning routine revamp**: 48-hour expiry (was day-based), profile freshness check, verdict-aware nudge format, 4-button layout

### Key decisions
- **"Screen" not "Queue"** -- renamed K2B Queue playlist to K2B Screen. "Screen this" is clearer than "Queue this" for "K2B, check if this is worth watching"
- **45-min duration cap** (not 20 min) -- Keith watches longer videos if good. Cap only for unknown/low-affinity channels
- **Truncate to 2000 words for screening** -- full transcript unnecessary for verdict generation, saves time
- **Optional skip reason** -- skip logs immediately (zero friction), "Why?" asked as ignorable follow-up
- **Watch as callback not URL button** -- enables logging watch action for learning loop
- **Separate youtube-preference-profile.md** from general preference-profile.md -- domain-specific, read directly by recommend workflow

### Files changed
- `k2b-remote/src/youtube.ts` -- verdict, verdict_value, pillars_matched, comment_text fields + screen/watch/comment signal types
- `k2b-remote/src/bot.ts` -- 4 new callback handlers, awaitingComment state, handleCommentOrSkipReason, revamped sendPendingNudges
- `.claude/skills/k2b-youtube-capture/SKILL.md` -- two-pass pipeline replacing single-pass, revamped morning routine
- `.claude/skills/k2b-observer/SKILL.md` -- Phase 1e YouTube harvesting, Phase 3b preference profile synthesis, updated integration map
- `K2B-Vault/Notes/Context/youtube-preference-profile.md` -- initial empty structure (confidence: low)
- `K2B-Vault/Notes/Context/youtube-playlists.md` -- K2B Queue renamed to K2B Screen
- `K2B-Vault/Notes/Features/feature_two-pass-youtube.md` -- feature spec
- `K2B-Vault/MOC_K2B-Roadmap.md` -- added to In Progress

### Deploy
- Synced to Mac Mini: skills + CLAUDE.md + k2b-remote code. Built clean, pm2 restarted.

## 2026-03-31 -- K2B Mission Control Dashboard v1

Built a full web dashboard for K2B -- single-page dark theme mission control that shows the state of the entire system at a glance.

### What was built
- **k2b-dashboard/** -- standalone Express + React + Vite app (TypeScript throughout)
- 9 API endpoints reading from vault files, SQLite, JSONL, TSV, git, and pm2
- 10 panel components: System Status, Vault Stats, Roadmap, YouTube Digest, Inbox, Intelligence, Skill Activity, Scheduled Tasks, Content Pipeline, Activity Feed
- SSH fallback to Mac Mini for pm2 status and scheduled tasks when running on MacBook
- Live YouTube playlist polling via yt-dlp (cached 1 hour)
- Dark monospace theme (#0a0a0a background, JetBrains Mono, mission control aesthetic)
- Click-to-expand rows with always-visible subtitles
- Responsive layout (stacks on mobile for Tailscale commute access)

### Key decisions
- **Standalone app** (not embedded in k2b-remote) -- separate pm2 process, dashboard stays up even when iterating on bot code
- **Read-only v1** -- no write operations. Action buttons (YouTube skip, inbox triage) are v2
- **SSH to Mac Mini** for remote data -- system status and scheduled tasks pulled from Mini when local data unavailable
- **Polling (30s)** not WebSocket -- simple, reliable for v1
- **Skill Activity heatmap** with bar chart showing which skills are hot vs dormant, with "Try:" hints for never-used skills
- **K2B Intelligence panel** shows observer candidates, recent learnings with reinforcement counts, observer status
- **YouTube Queue** shows live playlist items (via yt-dlp on Mac Mini) not just processed history

### Bug fixes during build
- Fixed API/component field mismatches (contentPipeline, scheduledTasks, activity feed, skills, intelligence)
- Fixed learnings parser (markdown list prefix `- **Field:**` not matched by regex)
- Added bar chart CSS for skill activity
- Fixed Header always showing "offline" (was checking nonexistent `status` field)
- Fixed YouTube Queue showing processed history instead of current playlist items

### Vault updates
- Created `feature_mission-control.md` (shipped)
- Updated `project_k2b.md`, `project_k2b-always-on.md`, `MOC_K2B-Roadmap.md`, `MOC_K2B-System.md`

### Deploy
- Not yet deployed to Mac Mini. Run `/sync` to push.
- On Mini: `npm install && npm run build && pm2 start dist/server/index.js --name k2b-dashboard`

---

## 2026-03-31 -- YouTube Taste Learning Loop + Vault Housekeeping

### 1. Features/Shipped subfolder convention
- Created `Notes/Features/Shipped/` for completed feature specs (distinct from Archive)
- Added "Roadmap & Feature Notes" section to CLAUDE.md: Roadmap MOC = index, feature notes = detailed specs only when needed
- Moved ai-human-guardrail, proactive-youtube, playlist-redesign to Shipped

### 2. YouTube taste learning loop (Phase 1 + Phase 2 conversational redesign)
- Added skip-why buttons to Telegram: [Too basic] [Clickbait] [Not relevant] [Too long]
- Added value-feedback buttons after highlights: [Exactly my level] [Gave me an idea] [Good but basic] [Not worth it]
- New `appendFeedbackSignal()` in youtube.ts writes to `youtube-feedback-signals.jsonl`
- Extended `YouTubeRecommendation` interface: topics, skip_reason, value_signal, search_query
- Updated observer-prompt.md with YouTube Taste Synthesis section (generates youtube_taste object)
- Updated observer-loop.sh to write `youtube-taste-profile.md` when taste data present
- Updated SKILL.md: recommend workflow now reads taste profile, 5-dimension scoring with confidence-weighted taste fit
- Scheduled `/youtube recommend` every other day at 11am HKT
- **v2 redesign**: Replaced rigid button-based feedback with conversational flow
  - Removed skip-why buttons and value-feedback buttons
  - Skip now triggers agent conversation: "What put you off?" -> Keith responds naturally -> K2B extracts and logs reason
  - Highlights now includes K2B's honest assessment of whether it's worth Keith's time, asks his opinion conversationally
  - Removed rigid [Content idea] [Feature] [Insight] [Nothing] promotion buttons -- agent handles promotion/playlist moves through conversation
  - Nudge messages redesigned: added YouTube link, duration, pick_reason, [Watch] URL button
  - Free-text feedback (`signal_text`) captured alongside structured signals for richer observer pattern detection

### 3. Scheduled tasks wiped (again) and restored
- Manual rsync overwrote Mac Mini production SQLite database (SAME bug as E-2026-03-29-002)
- Restored all 5 original tasks + added new youtube recommend task (6 total)
- Logged as E-2026-03-31-001, reinforced L-2026-03-29-002 to 3x (medium confidence)
- Rule: NEVER manual rsync for k2b-remote. ALWAYS use `scripts/deploy-to-mini.sh code`

### 4. Agent SDK systemPrompt 403 fix
- Uncommitted agent.ts changes (systemPrompt preset/append) were synced to Mac Mini for the first time
- SDK 0.1.77 doesn't support systemPrompt config -- caused 403 Forbidden on all agent calls
- Reverted systemPrompt block, redeployed via deploy-to-mini.sh (not manual rsync)

### 5. SSH Keychain limitation documented
- macOS Keychain blocks credential access from non-interactive SSH sessions
- Claude CLI auth works interactively on Mac Mini but fails via SSH
- All pm2-based paths (Telegram, scheduled tasks) work fine -- only direct SSH agent invocation affected
- Documented in project_k2b-always-on.md Known Issues

**Key decisions:**
- Taste profile starts permissive (weight 0.15 at low confidence) and tightens as signals accumulate (0.30 at high confidence)
- No hard filtering -- taste scores are soft ranking adjustments, never exclusions
- Conversational feedback captures richer signals than rigid buttons -- Keith's actual words are more valuable than 4 fixed categories
- deploy-to-mini.sh is the ONLY acceptable way to deploy k2b-remote code
- All Telegram sends go through the bot process (Grammy), never through the agent directly

---

## 2026-03-30 -- Tailscale Remote Access + Proxy Support for System Proxy Mode

**What was built/changed:**

### 1. Proxy Support for k2b-remote
- Installed `https-proxy-agent` for Grammy bot proxy routing
- Wired proxy into Grammy bot constructor (`bot.ts`) via `client.baseFetchConfig.agent` -- only activates when `HTTP_PROXY` env var is set
- Wired proxy into Agent SDK (`agent.ts`) via `options.env` passing `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` to Claude Code subprocess
- Added `HTTP_PROXY` config to `config.ts` with fallback chain: `.env` file -> `process.env`
- Created `ecosystem.config.cjs` locally (was previously Mac Mini only) with proxy env vars defaulting to port 7897

### 2. Mac Mini Network Mode Change
- Switched Mac Mini Clash Verge from TUN mode to System Proxy mode (port 7897)
- Added `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY` to Mac Mini `~/.zshenv` for all CLI tools (gws, curl, etc.)
- Restarted observer loop with proxy env vars (curl in minimax-common.sh needs proxy)
- All external APIs verified working through proxy: Telegram, Anthropic, Groq, MiniMax, Google

### 3. Tailscale Mesh Networking
- Installed Tailscale standalone on Mac Mini (IP: `100.116.205.17`, full mode)
- Installed Tailscale standalone on MacBook (IP: `100.68.35.19`, full mode)
- No TUN conflict on Mac Mini (System Proxy mode) or MacBook (Tailscale coexists with Clash TUN)
- Added `macmini-ts` SSH alias in `~/.ssh/config` for remote access via Tailscale
- Tested from mobile hotspot (different network) -- SSH works

### 4. Vault Documentation
- Updated `project_k2b-always-on.md` with Phase 7 (Tailscale + proxy), updated specs table, known issues, operational commands
- Updated `MOC_K2B-System.md` architecture diagram with Tailscale IPs and proxy details
- Updated TLDR action items (3 of 4 remote gaps now resolved)
- Updated Mac Mini memory reference with Tailscale and proxy info

**Key decisions:**
- Mac Mini uses System Proxy (not TUN) so Tailscale can run in full mode as SSH target
- MacBook keeps TUN mode (Claude Desktop requires it) -- Tailscale works alongside it
- Proxy wiring is conditional: code works identically with or without `HTTP_PROXY` set
- Port 7897 (not 7890) is Clash Verge's default on the Mac Mini

**Learnings captured:** L-2026-03-30-003 through L-2026-03-30-008 (Grammy restart after mode change, config.ts env source, port mismatch, proxy wiring architecture, Tailscale+Clash compatibility, all-processes-need-proxy)

## 2026-03-30 -- Claude Code Hooks, MiniMax Background Observer, Proactive YouTube

**What was built/changed:**

### 1. Claude Code Hooks (inspired by Everything Claude Code repo)
- Created `scripts/hooks/session-start.sh` -- deterministic session startup (usage triggers, inbox scan, observer candidates, high-confidence learnings)
- Created `scripts/hooks/stop-observe.sh` -- captures vault file changes after every Claude response to `observations.jsonl`
- Created `.claude/settings.json` -- project-level hooks config wiring both hooks

### 2. MiniMax Background Observer
- Created `scripts/observer-loop.sh` -- background process calling MiniMax-M2.5 API to analyze K2B usage patterns (~$0.007/analysis)
- Created `scripts/observer-prompt.md` -- structured analysis prompt (skill patterns, revision patterns, YouTube behavior)
- Fixed `scripts/minimax-common.sh` -- platform-aware vault path detection (MacBook vs Mac Mini)
- Deployed to Mac Mini as pm2 process `k2b-observer-loop`
- Gate: 20+ observations, 1hr cooldown, 7am-11pm HKT active hours

### 3. Confidence-Scored Learnings
- Updated `k2b-feedback` skill -- learnings now carry low/medium/high confidence based on reinforcement count
- Session-start hook auto-loads high-confidence (6+) learnings into context

### 4. Proactive YouTube Knowledge Acquisition
- Created `k2b-remote/src/youtube.ts` -- JSONL data layer for recommendation tracking + dedup
- Added Telegram inline keyboard buttons to `bot.ts` -- [Get highlights] [Skip] + promotion flow [Content idea] [Feature] [Insight] [Nothing]
- Added `callback_query:data` handler for all YouTube button interactions
- Added `/youtube morning` subcommand to k2b-youtube-capture skill
- Wired `sendPendingNudges` into scheduler.ts -- buttons sent after morning task completes
- Created scheduled task: daily 7am HKT `Run /youtube morning`
- Observer prompt updated to analyze YouTube watch/skip/promote patterns

### 5. Documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md -- hooks, observer loop, Mac Mini pm2 processes, /youtube morning
- Updated README.md -- full architecture diagram, skills table, self-improvement loop, tech stack
- Updated vault: Home.md, MOC_K2B-Roadmap.md, project_k2b.md, new feature_background-observer.md
- Created spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-29-proactive-youtube-knowledge-acquisition-design.md`
- Created plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-03-29-proactive-youtube-knowledge-acquisition.md`

**Key decisions:**
- MiniMax-M2.5 (minimaxi.com, $0.30/M in) chosen over Claude Haiku for background observer -- cheaper, Keith's existing subscription is underused
- Vault JSONL over SQLite for YouTube tracking -- observer needs to read the data, SQLite is opaque to it
- Extended existing k2b-youtube-capture skill rather than creating new k2b-youtube-morning skill -- one skill, cleaner
- Inline Telegram buttons via Grammy InlineKeyboard rather than text-based replies -- better UX

**Files affected:**
- `.claude/settings.json` -- new (hooks config)
- `.claude/skills/k2b-feedback/SKILL.md` -- confidence scoring
- `.claude/skills/k2b-observer/SKILL.md` -- background observer integration
- `.claude/skills/k2b-youtube-capture/SKILL.md` -- /youtube morning subcommand
- `k2b-remote/src/bot.ts` -- inline buttons, callback handler, sendPendingNudges
- `k2b-remote/src/scheduler.ts` -- post-task nudge sending
- `k2b-remote/src/youtube.ts` -- new (JSONL data layer)
- `scripts/hooks/session-start.sh` -- new
- `scripts/hooks/stop-observe.sh` -- new
- `scripts/observer-loop.sh` -- new
- `scripts/observer-prompt.md` -- new + YouTube patterns
- `scripts/minimax-common.sh` -- platform-aware vault path
- `CLAUDE.md` -- hooks, observer, youtube morning docs
- `README.md` -- comprehensive rewrite

---

## 2026-03-29 -- Git Setup & Session Discipline

**What was built/changed:**
- Updated root .gitignore with comprehensive ignore rules (secrets, node_modules, dist, store, workspace/uploads, logs, pids)
- Created DEVLOG.md with standard entry template
- Added "Session Discipline" section to CLAUDE.md enforcing end-of-session commits and devlog entries
- Committed all previously uncommitted work: 12 new skills, vault-writer references, scripts, migration-exports, k2b-remote health endpoint, MCP config

**Files affected:**
- `.gitignore` -- expanded from 2 rules to full coverage
- `DEVLOG.md` -- created
- `CLAUDE.md` -- added Session Discipline section
- `.claude/skills/k2b-email/` -- new skill

- `.claude/skills/k2b-vault-writer/references/` -- Obsidian syntax references (moved from deleted obsidian-markdown skill)
- `scripts/` -- deploy, LinkedIn, MiniMax, YouTube helper scripts
- `k2b-remote/src/health.ts` -- new health endpoint
- `k2b-remote/scripts/health-check.sh` -- health check script

**Key decisions:**
- Single root .gitignore covers the whole project; k2b-remote keeps its own .gitignore for subdir-specific rules
- migration-exports/ included in repo (reference material, no secrets)
- obsidian-markdown skill deleted; its references moved under k2b-vault-writer
- k2b-learn, k2b-error, k2b-request consolidated into k2b-feedback

**Status:**
- What works: Git repo with full history, all skills and code tracked
- What's incomplete: Nothing -- this is a housekeeping commit
- What's next: Normal development with session-end commit discipline
